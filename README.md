# Kaspa Receipts

A receipt for every transaction. A statement for your wallet. Kaspa financial documents, generated instantly.

A pure client-side single-page app. No backend, no database, no build step — just a static HTML file you can open in a browser or deploy anywhere.

## Live Website

**[kaspa-receipts.onrender.com](https://kaspa-receipts.onrender.com/)** — hosted on Render's global CDN. No installation required.

## Features

- **Transaction Receipt** — Paste a Kaspa TX hash to see a paper-style receipt with from/to addresses, amounts, confirmation status, and USD value.
- **Wallet History** — Enter a `kaspa:` address with a date range to get a paginated transaction history with net summary.
- **FIFO Cost-Basis Tracking** — Automatically computes realized gain/loss on every sent transaction using First-In-First-Out lot accounting across the full wallet history. Cost basis, sale value, and profit are shown per-transaction and aggregated in the summary.
- **USD Pricing** — Fetches daily KAS/USDT rates from Bybit (up to 1000 days). USD equivalents shown on receipts, statement rows, net summary, and CSV export.
- **Transaction Classification** — Automatically detects `Received`, `Sent`, or `Self` (self-transfer) transactions.
- **CSV Export** — Download transaction history as a CSV file including cost basis and realized gain columns.
- **Dark Mode** — Full dark theme with Kaspa brand colors.

## Usage

### Single Transaction

1. Paste a 64-character transaction hash (hex) into the input.
2. Click **Look Up**.

5. Each sent transaction displays its realized gain/loss based on FIFO lot matching.

## Run Locally

Uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom). 130+ tests covering API, DOM rendering, utility functions, and FIFO cost-basis logic.

## API

All data is fetched live from:

- **Kaspa public API** — `api.kaspa.org` for transactions, balances, and address history.

No data is stored locally. No server-side components.

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES modules)
- CSS custom properties
